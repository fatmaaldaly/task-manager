# Simple Task Manager App

### Overview

This is a basic Task Manager application built with React Native and Expo. The app allows users to create, manage, and delete tasks. It's designed to demonstrate fundamental React Native concepts, including state management with hooks, user interaction handling, and component styling.

### App Features

- **Add Task:** Type a description into the input field and press the 'Add' button to add a new task to your list.
- **Mark as Complete:** Tap on a task in the list to toggle its completion status. Completed tasks will be visually distinguished with a strikethrough.
- **Delete Task:** Tap the 'X' or delete icon next to a task to remove it from the list.
- **Task List:** All tasks are displayed in a scrollable list view.

### Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the repository** (or download the source code):

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/task-manager.git
   cd task-manager-app

   ```

2. Install dependencies:

npm install
or
yarn install

3. Run the app:

- For Android: npx react-native run-android

- For iOS: npx react-native run-ios

Or, if youâ€™re using Expo: npx expo start

- After starting the development server, a QR code will be displayed in your terminal. You can use the **Expo Go** app on your phone (available on the App Store and Google Play) to scan the QR code and run the app.

Alternatively, you can run it on an iOS or Android simulator by following the instructions in the terminal.

### Third-Party Libraries

This project uses the following libraries:

- React Native: Core framework for building the app.
- TypeScript: Provides type safety and better developer experience.
